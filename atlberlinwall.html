                <p class="paragraph-text">When a black doctor attempted to purchase a house in the Peyton Forest
                    subdivision in 1962, residents of this white development secured the aldermanic boardâ€™s approval for
                    the closing and barricading of sections of Peyton and Harlan Roads. Both roads were used for
                    north-south travel, and their closing was designed to maintain the white neighborhoods south of the
                    barriers. Mayor Ivan Allen understood and approved of this undertaking and actually asked the public
                    works committee of the aldermanic board to set up the concrete and steel barricades as racial
                    roadblocks.
