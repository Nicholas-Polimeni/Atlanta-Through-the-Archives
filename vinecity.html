                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">After the Great Atlanta Fire of 1917, residents began to move into the Vine
                    City area. The City of Atlanta began numerous public housing projects as a response to the growing
                    population, but failed to properly maintain the properties. Residents protest against the
                    substandard living conditions, including Martin Luther King, Jr.. In the 1980s, Vine City began to
                    face a declining population and increasing number of empty public housing units.

                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    (1917) The Great Atlanta Fire of 1917 burns through Old Fourth Ward, displacing over 10,000 people.
                    Black residents move further west along Simpson Road (today’s Joseph E. Boone Boulevard) and settle
                    in the English Avenue/Vine City area. As black families attempt to move north of Boone Blvd., white
                    residents cause violence and bombings.<br><br>

                    (1934) “The outstanding success of University Homes was due to the fact that University Homes was
                    made of a highly intelligent board of directors and an educational group, people who had been in
                    education for years and people who considered housing to be a part of good education.<br>
                    “I might’ve joined [Mr. Hope] on a couple trips to Washington, helping him do what he needed to do.
                    But you must understand that the white project picked up and carried Mr. Hope along knowing they
                    might explain to Washington the needs of Negroes generally.” -Lorimer D. Milton, Atlanta businessman
                    and banker, hired by John Hope (president at time of Morehouse College) to head Department of
                    Economics and Business Administration, later on Board of Directors of University Homes.<br><br>

                    (1937) (before University Homes is built, same area near Chestnut Road) “It was a kind of rough
                    neighborhood before they put the [University Homes] in. All down here, they used to call it Beaver
                    Slide and it was rough. It was really rough down here…People did anything they wanted to do, they
                    shoot crap into the street, and if you come along walking you'd better walk out of the street and
                    not try to go through them.” -Clara Render, resident.<br><br>

                    (1938) “No one thought it was necessary to hire a [landscape architect] on a salary…to keep up the
                    entire grounds of a building…the Housing Authority was going to see that [Clark Howell Homes] was
                    done but it was so alien to the usual thinking around the city…” She says City Hall was the main
                    opposition to hiring landscape architects for these public housing projects. -Edith Henderson,
                    female landscape architect planning and designing team of Clark Howell Homes.<br><br>

                    (1967) Spelman College economics professor Marcia L. Halvorsen publishes her project “An Analysis…on
                    Vine City…a Negro Slum Ghetto.” Her study finds only 20% of the homes are owned by their residents
                    and over 30% of families are paying mortgages—but these are the families considered more “well off”
                    than the rest of Vine City. A resident says “we do the best we can and that is all that can be
                    done—we just never know what will happen.”<br>
                    An interviewer says “to me the house is in terrible condition. [The resident] is very satisfied with
                    the house. It is clean in the sense that she has swept and dusted plus straighted it up; but the
                    house needs painting, replastering, and a plumber.”<br>
                    54% of families interviewed had lived in Vine City for five years or longer, so there is a strong
                    sense of community with the long-term residents. More are “afraid to complain about their housing
                    from fear of having to move or…facing a higher rent.”<br><br>

                    (1974) Lyndon A. Wade sends Mayor Maynard H. Jackson a letter about the establishment of a new
                    Neighborhood Improvement Program. Under the Atlanta Urban League, NIP would focus on Vine City and
                    south Atlanta, establishing community parks and gardens, refurbishing public school facilities, and
                    working with the mayor’s office for sanitation and housing concerns.<br><br>

                    (1978) The Department of Housing and Urban Development denies the city of Atlanta’s application for
                    a 300-housing unit under the Section Eight Program because it does not meet the Site and
                    Neighborhood Standards criteria that 1) the site has the utilities to accommodate residents and 2)
                    the site is a racially-mixed area and increases the minority-to-majority ratio. It is found that the
                    federal law prohibits housing development funds for areas of heavy minority concentration. The
                    property does not meet the “good market area” standards.<br>
                    << /br>

                        (1989) Vine City starts to face a 12% decline in the total of housing units, translating to a
                        whole
                        devaluation of the black neighborhood. Vine City has a 56% increase in vacant units. Black
                        residents
                        continue renting homes from the difficulty of receiving loans for home purchasing.
