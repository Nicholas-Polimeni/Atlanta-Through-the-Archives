                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">With a stock of dilapidated public housing and as the host city of the 1996
                    Olympics, Atlanta dramatically shifts its historic housing policy to emphasize new mixed-income
                    market-based housing and begins the destruction of its remaining housing.<br><br>
                    This decade included a substantial push for revitalization that focused on Black people in Black
                    neighborhoods—not Black people influencing white neighborhoods or white people taking over Black
                    neighborhoods. Funding projects such as HUD’s Empowerment Zones aimed to encourage the private
                    sector in urban redevelopment through community and economic development programs. Similarly, the
                    HOPE VI program brought significant changes to the public housing landscape, pushing projects to
                    mixed-income and often dramatically reducing the number of units (without any plans in place for
                    displaced residents). Most public housing projects in Atlanta were converted to HOPE VI mixed-income
                    developments or demolished entirely.
