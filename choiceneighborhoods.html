                <p class="paragraph-text">The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development began the Choice
                    Neighborhoods Implementation Grant program to succeed the HOPE VI public housing demolition and
                    revitalization program. Created in 2009, the CNIG program looks to address the “comprehensive
                    approach to neighborhood revitalization,” which was viewed as a substantial shortcoming of the HOPE
                    VI program. Under this new framework, local governments, public housing agencies, nonprofits, and
                    for-profit developers could apply for funds for HUD-assisted rental housing and distressed housing.
                    Specifically, the AHA and City of Atlanta received $30 million from the grant to in the
                    revitalization initiative of the former University Homes public housing site and created the
                    University Choice Neighborhood encompassing Atlanta University Center (AUC), Ashview Heights, and
                    Vine City. AHA received a Choice Neighborhood Planning Grant in 2020 to design a Transformation Plan
                    for the former Bowen Homes public housing site in Northwest Atlanta. The Bowen Choice neighborhood
                    includes this site, the Carey Park neighborhood, and the business corridor along Donald Lee
                    Hollowell Parkway. The completion of this Transformation Plan will be used to apply for the
                    Implementation Grant.
