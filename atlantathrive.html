                <p class="paragraph-text">Atlanta Thrive is a non-profit parent advocacy group focusing on rectifying
                    the racial inequities in Atlanta’s public school education system, particularly against Black
                    children. While the organization fights to change public schools in the entire city, the movement
                    began with the Thomasville Heights Elementary School, when parents were made aware of the fact that
                    the school was given a failing grade by the Department of Education. Since 2019, the group has
                    contacted over 10,000 families in the lowest-performing school districts and gathered information to
                    promote their activism and better protest the schools’ conditions.
