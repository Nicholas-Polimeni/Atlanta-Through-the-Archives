                <p class="paragraph-text">In the 1960s, the Jim Crow laws prohibiting Black vendors from selling their
                    products were banned. However, also in the 1960s, many Black residents were displaced from the
                    rezoning favoring white neighborhoods and businesses, as well as the construction of the expressway.
                    Black displacement and white flight significantly harmed sales in the market, and supermarkets began
                    to replace the demand for smaller, often farmer vendors.
