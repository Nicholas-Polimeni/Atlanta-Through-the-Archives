                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">Collier Heights represents a successful Black-led and organized neighborhood
                    that capitalized on white Atlantans' fears and the opportunity for Black community
                    development.<br><br>
                    In the 1940s, Atlanta Urban League’s Secretary Thompson leads effort to create “Negro Expansion
                    Areas” to counteract the rapid spread of white neighborhoods into Atlantan suburbs. They fear that
                    this trend will only leave pockets in already crowded urban spaces for Black people. The Atlanta
                    Urban League creates Project X, a Black effort to use Jim Crow psychology to their advantage. They
                    conducted land data studies to see what portions of West Atlanta outside the city zoning boundaries
                    were uninhabited and cheap, so they could buy up the land and further ‘deplete’ the value so white
                    families and investors wouldn’t want to invest there or in adjacent areas. After collecting data and
                    finding the Collier Heights area to fit the criteria, the group creates a corporation made up of 23
                    Auburn Avenue business people as shareholders to fund the venture, and buy 177 acres in three
                    parcels to sell to Black families. <br><br>
                    Despite some civic efforts for white residents to hold their
                    ground and not sell property in the surrounding area, racial prejudice eventually took over and
                    every white resident sold. Black suburbanization grew substantially through the 1960s and early
                    1970s, being labeled as the “Atlanta – Black Mecca of the South” by Ebony magazine in 1971. With
                    over 2000 homes, the 1960s and 1970s represented peak Collier Heights for middle and upper class
                    Black families. However, after the 1970s, commercial development and higher-density multi-family
                    developments replaced the slowing of single-family residential development, and issues of crime and
                    insufficient funding have also contributed to the decline of population and upkeep since then.
