                    Road NE near the intersection of Roxboro)</h2>
                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">The Aldermanic Board votes 13-4 to overturn a previous zoning committee
                    decision, signing off on the construction of public housing at the Peachtree Road site. The project
                    was the first public housing constructed in Buckhead; there were three other public housing sites in
                    the wider Northside area, but not in the exclusive northeastern enclave. In comparison, during the
                    previous two years, eight projects were recently built or under construction in the southeastern
                    part of the city.<br><br>
                    This project was met with fierce community resistance. The Ridgedale Park Civic League claimed it
                    violated zoning ordinances and filed a request to the Fulton County Superior Court to halt the
                    Aldermanic Boardâ€™s approval. Their lawsuit also argued that required reviews of the property were
                    not conducted, that the property owner did not approve of the zoning change, and that this decision
                    violated the Sunshine law. Other community concerns included the traffic flow through a nearby
                    intersection and the increased burden on the sewage system.<br><br>
                    No significant evidence against the plan was demonstrated, enabling the project to continue. At the
                    site, a highrise with 118 one-bedroom units for the elderly was constructed.
