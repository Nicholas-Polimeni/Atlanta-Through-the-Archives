                <p class="paragraph-text">The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 formally reaffirms the terms
                    outlined in the Housing Act of 1949, and Congress acknowledges its goal of “a decent home and
                    suitable living environment for every American family” has not fully been met since 1949. The
                    Secretary of Housing and Urban Development plans with the Secretary of Labor to provide job
                    opportunities relating to the “planning, construction, rehabilitation, and operation of housing
                    assisted under such programs” to lower income residents in those areas.
