                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">With the recent success of Techwood and University Homes, Atlanta began
                    numerous new housing projects and urban projects, which either created new segregated housing, or
                    divided and displaced once-connected communities.<br><br>
                    After leading the country’s construction of its first ever public housing projects, Atlanta in the
                    40s continued to attract national attention and fund even more projects – these housing sites were
                    all segregated by race. New sites were built as ‘sister projects,’ where projects for black
                    Atlanteans were built to match every project built for white Atlanteans. These sites were
                    strategically chosen in order to demolish the city’s ‘slums’, and often exasperated existing
                    residential segregation as well as displacement (many of those cleared in the preexisting
                    neighborhoods could not afford to live in the newly built projects). Despite these considerations,
                    slum clearance and public housing construction was largely viewed as a positive force not only for
                    Atlanta’s population, but for black residents in particular. In the late 40s, the first stretch of
                    expressway was constructed, leading to the displacement of even more Black families. In response,
                    residents asked for the construction of more housing projects.
