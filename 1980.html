                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">With the Reagan presidency, sweeping changes in housing policy occurred at the
                    federal level, starting a period of stagnation for housing in Atlanta, and setting the stage for its
                    dramatic policy shift in the next decade.<br><br>
                    The conservative ideology in the White House has a significant impact on federal policy regarding
                    public expenditures, integration, and the role of the private sector in social services. Direct
                    expenditure funding for housing programs is slashed, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit is
                    created to involve the private sector in the construction and maintenance of affordable housing. In
                    the late 80s, the proportion of residents in public housing peaks in Atlanta, with Atlanta having the
                    highest percent of residents living in public housing in the entire US.
