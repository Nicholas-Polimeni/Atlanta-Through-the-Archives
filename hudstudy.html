                <p class="paragraph-text">The US Department of Housing and Urban Development publishes an inconclusive
                    study on the connection between EZ and EC programs and overall community growth. While specific
                    businesses that are given tax breaks or investments experienced benefit at the time, there was not
                    strong enough data to show that the benefits were widespread enough to pull the entire community
                    zone up.
