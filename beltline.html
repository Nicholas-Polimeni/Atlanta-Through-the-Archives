                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">The idea for Atlanta’s Beltline originated in a master’s thesis by Georgia
                    Tech graduate Ryan Gavel in 1999, who wanted to create a transportation alternative around the city
                    on the bones of railroad corridors. After support grew from politicians, business owners, and
                    residents, Atlanta’s City Council approved the feasibility report, and the
                    nonprofit Atlanta BeltLine Partnership used a variety of funding sources to begin construction,
                    including a Tax Allocation District (TAD). The multi-use trail’s development plan of over 22 miles
                    around the city was passed by City Council, Fulton County Commissioners, and Atlanta School Board in
                    2005 and included 5,600 housing units to mitigate displacement.<br><br>
                    Since construction began, home values and property taxes have taken a toll on the original
                    residents. With less than a decade until the proposed completion of the project, the BeltLine
                    Partnership launched the Legacy Resident Retention Program in 2021 to potentially alleviate economic
                    pressure on lower income citizens. The program intends to cover the cost increase of property taxes
                    for homeowners who make less than 100% of the median income for the area, which is $55,800 per year
                    for a single-person household, or $79,700 for a family of four.
