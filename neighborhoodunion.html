                <p class="paragraph-text">The Neighborhood Union was a network of black women who gathered to advocate
                    for the development of social programs in neighborhoods. After its development and growing presence
                    in the area, the City of Atlanta called on the NU to lead various campaigns and movements. The NU
                    continued to expand and led efforts to improve after-school programs for children, public facility
                    sanitation, and greater access to home-making skill classes.

                    Lugenia Burns Hope began the Neighborhood Union in 1908. A black woman went missing, and the
                    neighborhood investigated to find her passed away in her home. Women were assigned to each district
                    of the West End to establish a communication network.<br><br>
                    The Neighborhood Union purchased property on Lee Street, which runs through current-day Morehouse
                    College and Spelman College’s campuses. Officially, the NU was designated to serve the First Ward of
                    Atlanta. The physical location conducted economics and home-making classes, lectures, and
                    recreational activities for children. By 1911, the NU expanded to the First and Fourth Wards, South
                    Atlanta, Pittsburgh, and Vine City.<br><br>
                    Neighborhood Union became a taxed organization in 1911 and established its charter, its aim to
                    “develop among the people the spirit of [cooperation], group consciousness and mass movement for the
                    development of the neighborhood.” It described itself as an “outgrowth” of a community of black
                    women, operating under the motto “And thy neighbor as thy self.” The city of Atlanta turturnedns
                    over the majority of its social work needs to the NU. Five neighborhoods in majority black areas
                    became organized under the NU.<br><br>
                    In 1914, the City of Atlanta called on NU to lead a sanitation campaign in black neighborhoods with
                    the help of the Atlanta Anti-Tuberculosis Association. In 1915, the NU established a health center
                    to serve the Black community in West Atlanta; “at the height of the depression.... over 4000 people
                    used the services of the Health center” (Lerner 69). <br><br>
                    By 1924, the Neighborhood Union expanded to three locations: northeastern Atlanta, Summerhill, and
                    Atlanta’s west side. The union established
                    more departments, namely Better Housing, which conducted “house to house visitation and cooperation”
                    with the Board of Health and Sanitary Department, and Health and Sanitation, and Care of the Sick,
                    which provides health courses under the Red Cross.
                    <br><br> During its time, the Union also significantly
                    contributed to the Carrie-Steele-Pitts Orphan Home, the Spelman College Nursery School, and the Gate
                    City Free Kindergarten Association.
