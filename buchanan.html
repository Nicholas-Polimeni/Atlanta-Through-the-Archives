                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">Buchanan, a black homebuyer, is denied a property purchase by Warley, a white
                    homeowner in Louisville, Kentucky. The city of Louisville had a city-wide ordinance to “prevent
                    conflict and ill-feeling between the white and colored races in the city of Louisville…[with] the
                    use of separate blocks” for residential areas. A section of the ordinance made it unlawful for black
                    residents to move into a neighborhood with majority-white residences. Because Warley’s neighborhood
                    had eight of its ten homes occupied by white families, Buchanan was denied the home. The Court found
                    the Louisville ordinance was unconstitutional and violated the Fourteenth Amendment through state
                    interference in personal property.
