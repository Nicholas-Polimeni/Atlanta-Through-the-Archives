                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">The current land used for the Auburn Pointe mixed-income community was
                    originally the space for Grady Homes. Constructed in 1942, the Grady Homes public housing initiative
                    was a significant piece of the government’s slum clearance efforts in the mid-20th century.
                    Originally a thriving community, the housing project included hundreds of new units and community
                    services such as a daycare and playground. However, as decades went on, national funding for upkeep
                    dwindled, and crime and drug use took over. The AHA ultimately decided to destroy the units in 2005,
                    which was replaced in 2013 with the Ashley Auburn Pointe apartment complex, with 304 units
                    designated for low-income Atlantans.
