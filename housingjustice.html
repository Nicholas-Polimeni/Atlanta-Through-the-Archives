                <p class="paragraph-text">The Housing Justice League is a volunteer-led non-profit organization focusing
                    on Atlantans disproportionately hurt by historical housing discrimination and the modern housing
                    crisis. They have spread public information on how citizens can fight unfair eviction notices
                    legally and a policy plan to ameliorate the housing crisis and incentivize private investment in
                    affordable housing (called ​​HJL’s Affordable Housing Policy Package). They have also created a
                    report entitled, “BeltLining: Gentrification, Broken Promises, and Hope on Atlanta's Southside” to
                    educate on the Beltline’s role in increasing gentrification, as well as engaging in local activism
                    to gather stories and further educate.
