                <p class="paragraph-text">Atlanta in the 1970s was characterized by increased development, community
                    activism, and continuous attempts to integrate the all-white Northside.<br><br>
                    By the early 1970s, city-wide opinion of public housing was low and many viewed state-sponsored
                    projects as slums. While this change was occurring, development in the city was also taking place.
                    Hartsfield-Jackson Airport grew, the city expanded the I-75/85 connector, and MARTA began operating.
                    Some of these new developments threatened black businesses, homes, and communities, and when such
                    threats presented themselves, they were met with powerful community resistance. At the same time,
                    black organizers in the city fought to integrate the all-white neighborhoods of Atlantaâ€™s Northside
                    by establishing a low-income public housing project in the region. In response, members of the
                    Northside neighborhoods came together to protest and block proposed projects, often aided covertly
                    by the Aldermanic zoning board, and insisting that their hesitancy was not racially motivated but
                    rather out of concern for economic and safety interests.
