                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">The Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation in Chicago was denied a
                    zoning plan to build 190 low-income family units by the Village of Arlington Heights. The plan would
                    have rezoned a single-family residential area into a multi-family designated zone with federal
                    housing subsidies, and opponents argued the change would decrease the property value of the
                    surrounding area. Had the multi-family units been constructed, more low-income residents would have
                    moved into a predominantly wealthy, white residential area. The denial was claimed to have violated
                    the Fourteenth Amendment and Fair Housing Act, but the court found a lack of evidence the Village
                    used racial discrimination in their refusal.
