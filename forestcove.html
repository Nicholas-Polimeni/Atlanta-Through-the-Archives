                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">Forest Cove is a neighborhood in Southeast Atlanta for low-income citizens.
                    Delineated by HUD’s Section 8 Housing Voucher Program, residents of Forest Cove have rents
                    discounted to 30% of their income, with the rest subsidized by the federal government. Built in
                    1967, Thomasville Heights was the original housing project in this part of Atlanta, until crime and
                    deterioration forced the city to demolish the site in 2010 and replace it with Forest Cove.<br><br>
                    Unfortunately, problems that ignited Thomasville Heights’ destruction have persisted since the
                    renovations. From the beginning of 2020 to August of 2021, over 650 calls have been made to the
                    police for “domestic violence, burglary, robbery, and homicide at the property.” Even after the
                    private company Millennia Companies acquired the site in 2017, management has failed to fix the
                    structural code violations, including fire damage, rodent infestations, and building holes. This is
                    why a municipal court judge has ruled in late December 2021 that residents be relocated by March
                    before the neighborhood’s razing on April 15th; however, Millienia has asked for multiple
                    extensions, forcing residents to remain in substandard units.<br><br>
                    For the 210 remaining families of Forest Cove, relocation plans have yet to be solidified by
                    Millennia. An official timeline for neighborhood renovations is also still unclear, but Millennia
                    has stated that the 396-unit project will cost over $50 million.
