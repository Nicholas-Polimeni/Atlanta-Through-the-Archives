                <p class="paragraph-text">The first concrete proposal for public housing in Northside was at a site
                    bordered by Howell Mill Road and Collier Road. This proposal was quickly rejected; the Board of
                    Alderman voted 12-3 to rezone this site from residential to commercial, eliminating any potential of
                    its use for public housing. This site was a contentious issue for local organizations: the Atlanta
                    Regional Open Housing Coalition publicly called on Mayor Massell to reserve the decision, and an
                    unnamed neighborhood group fought for years against rezoning this site, only to quickly backtrack
                    once it was recommended for public housing.
