                <p class="paragraph-text"><em>How city officials systematically destroyed Sweet Auburn, the thriving
                        black
                        neighborhood and economic district.</em><br><br>

                    By the time HOLC agents began creating Atlanta’s redlining maps, Auburn Avenue had established
                    itself not only as a major economic district, but also as the city's black Mecca. Containing 142
                    black businesses and professionals as well as a fashionable residential district, the Sweet Auburn
                    neighborhood was renowned as the heart of black opportunity in the South. Despite the neighborhood’s
                    clear economic viability, in 1931, HOLC agents designated the Sweet Auburn area as grade D:
                    hazardous for investment. This rating was exemplary of white officials’ plans for the neighborhood:
                    from the 1940s to the 1970s, city officials targeted Sweet Auburn for relentless disruption, the two
                    largest instigators of which were the construction of the Atlanta expressway and the Butler Street
                    Urban Renewal project.<br><br>
                    Construction of the highway occurred throughout the 1950s, physically bisecting the Sweet Auburn
                    community while officials provided little to no replacement housing for those displaced by the
                    project. The neighborhood’s decline was only exasberated when, in 1957, officials began plans for
                    urban renewal along Auburn Avenue, allocating Federal funds of over $21 million towards ‘slum
                    clearance’ in the area. In the years following development, thousands of black businesses and
                    families were forcibly removed from the Sweet Auburn neighborhood. Displaced residents faced moving
                    in a city which was increasingly becoming segregated by a lack of affordable housing. Throughout the
                    1960s, a mass residential migration towards the WestSide of Atlanta occurred, all the while white
                    communities pushed back against the influx of black families, and city officials delayed
                    construction of new housing sites. By the 1970s, what once was the Sweet Auburn neighborhood was
                    nearly entirely absorbed by the expansion of the central business district. In 1976, the
                    neighborhood was designated a National Historic Landmark, and since then, the Historic District
                    Development Corporation, “has built and rehabilitated more than 110 single-family homes and more
                    than 50 units of affordable rental housing” and now focuses on renewal of the neighborhood’s
                    commercial district.
