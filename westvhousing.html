                    Plaintiffs Newell Edenfield, Wm. G. McRae, Wm. F. Buchanan argue in a petition that housing projects
                    must be in accordance with Atlanta’s zoning laws, but the Housing Authority (HA) is attempting to
                    develop residential units in a single-family residential area. The proposed project GA-67 is argued
                    to be an infraction of due process because it proposes “housing units to be constructed…shall be
                    occupied only by white persons, thus constituting an unconstitutional attempt at racial
                    segregation.” The HA argues the plaintiffs have no legal basis to argue against the development,
                    pointing to the Housing Authorities Law that does not forbid the HA from developing housing projects
                    for members of a single race. Plaintiffs argue GA-67 misuses the concept of eminent domain, taking
                    private property for a purpose other than “necessary public housing.” The court denies the
                    plaintiffs’ petition, stating it has no constitutional basis.
