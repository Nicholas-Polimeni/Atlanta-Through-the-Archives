                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">Northside, as an almost entirely white, wealthy enclave of Atlanta, did not
                    see the development of any public housing until after the 1970s. The main catalyst for movements to
                    integrate the area and for the construction of public housing developments were court orders against
                    Northside Realty Associates, the largest realty firm in Georgia. Northside Realty steered white and
                    black home seekers to different neighborhoods, refusing to work with black homebuyers who wanted to
                    buy in Northside. They were found in violation of the Fair Housing Act, and later in contempt of
                    court for not effectively altering their policies. As a result, city government was pressured to
                    increase public housing in Northside, lifting some of this burden from the southeastern part of the
                    city; a federal court order also mandated this shift. However, all projects met fierce resistance,
                    including lawsuits, from local white residents and community groups over false concerns.

                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    The Atlanta Region Open Housing Coalition (AROHC) and the Atlanta Community Relations Commission
                    (ACRC) conducted a study in 1975 regarding the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The study sent testers to
                    visit the offices of real estate companies and inquire about homes for sale in a specified price
                    range. Comments from firms were recorded and forwarded to the United States Department of Justice.
                    In 1971, a case brought against Northside Realty found it in violation of the Fair Housing Act, with
                    the ruling that they must cease their violation immediately. With the evidence of testers, in June
                    1975, the DOJ, the AROHC, and the ACRC filed a motion to hold Northside Realty in contempt of court
                    for their continued violation of the Fair Housing Act.<br><br>
                    The motion filed against Northside Realty claims that the firm steered white home seekers and
                    minority home seekers into different communities. One witness, Reverend Claude Peterson, an African
                    American resident, was told repeatedly that he could not afford a home in Northside and that he
                    would need to “pre-qualify” twice before he could even see listings. Other black witnesses shared
                    similar experiences, while white witnesses described how they were encouraged to look at homes.
                    In response, Northside Realty filed a counter, class-action lawsuit on behalf of all persons in the
                    real estate business against all testers, claiming that they are guilty of misconduct, including
                    trespassing and manufacturing false reports. The AROHC claims that this lawsuit violates federal law
                    meant to protect against intimidation preventing equal housing opportunity.<br><br>
                    In 1977, the lawsuit finds Northside Realty in contempt of court. Attorney Schwelb sought that the
                    court demand Northside Realty to allocate 15% of its advertising budget to black media and seek
                    black real estate agents for employment. However, the judge refused to agree to any such measures of
                    progress to be made by Northside Realty, but did not find it unreasonable that they must include an
                    equal housing opportunity logo in all advertising.
