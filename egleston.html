                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">In 1959, Atlanta officials began planning for an urban renewal project around
                    Butler Street and the Sweet Auburn Neighborhood, spurring controversy concerning the construction of
                    replacement housing for the black families who would be displaced by the project. To remedy the
                    situation, officials proposed a site located near the old Egleston hospital as the potential
                    location of a 350 unit, $3.5 million public housing project for blacks. The recommended site was
                    located in a majority white neighborhood -- and after being brought up amongst the Atlanta
                    Aldermanic board for approval, faced almost immediate backlash from the white residents of the
                    nearby neighborhood, who were intent on isolating themselves from the city’s black population. In
                    early December, just 24 hours before a petition for the site was to be heard amongst the Aldermanic
                    board, a “preacher” and other white residents frantically began to drum up community opposition to
                    the proposed public housing site. As a result, at the meeting the next day, the board voted against
                    approving the site for construction.<br><br>
                    Despite the board’s refusal, work for the renewal program continued even though housing for the
                    displaced had not been settled; Black leaders and community members became outraged. Through the end
                    of the year and into February, members of the community and concerned organizations protested the
                    board's decision and advocated for a successful reevaluation of the property. On February 25, 1960,
                    the Aldermanic board hosted a standing-room only hearing, where an estimated 1000 people attended to
                    debate the future of the city’s housing opportunities for blacks. Despite massive community support,
                    by March, the proposed site had finally failed. The Aldermanic board denied the property in a close
                    vote, and instead agreed to construct a project in the already black Bankhead neighborhood. Outrage
                    at the city’s blatant support of residential segregation continued well into the next year, by which
                    time hundreds of families still remained displaced and without homes.
