                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">In response to the Great Depression, new housing programs and guidelines were
                    launched, creating a legacy of public housing, urban renewal, displacement, and other de-facto means
                    of racial segregation in Atlanta and beyond.<br><br>
                    The federal government, attempting to lessen the consequences of the Great Depression, launched
                    dozens of programs targeted at housing. Atlanta became the birthplace of federally funded public
                    housing with two sibling projects: Techwood Homes, for White residents, and University Homes, for
                    Black residents. To make way for these historic complexes, acres of land, mostly inhabited by
                    African Americans, was razed. Many of those displaced were unable to live inside the new residences.
                    These projects would ignite Atlanta’s extensive history of public housing, slum clearance, urban
                    renewal, and displacement. <br><br>
                    At the same time, federal programs were created that would cement this
                    pattern, including the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, which made maps that categorized Atlanta’s
                    neighborhoods into different grades for loan purposes, largely based on their racial demographics.
                    These policies would cement a tradition of in-direct means of segregation.
