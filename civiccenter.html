                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">The Atlanta Civic Center opened in 1968 as a center for cultural arts and
                    community events. Since the late 70s, it has hosted concerts, musicals, and ceremonies. Weingarten
                    Realty purchased the site with the hopes of turning the Civic Center into a 650-unit mixed housing
                    apartment complex with a grocery store, but were unsuccessful and
                    gave up efforts in 2016.<br><br>
                    Site ownership transferred to the Atlanta Housing Authority in 2017, and in August of 2021 the AHA
                    issued a Request for Qualifications to turn the housing into a “true mixed-use” community with both
                    affordable and market rate housing, hotels, and retail office space. The purpose of the RFQ is for
                    the AHA to identify private developers to assist with the project. However, similar procurements for
                    projects were pursued in 2011 and 2014, so likelihood for the project’s funding and completion is
                    still undetermined.
