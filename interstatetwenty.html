                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">Interstate 20, the east-west corridor that connects with I-75 and I-85 in
                    Atlanta’s center, was deliberately plotted along a winding route in the late 1950s to serve, in the
                    words of Mayor Bill Hartsfield, as “the boundary between the white and Negro communities” on the
                    west side of town (Kruse, NYT). The construction resulted in the displacement of thousands of Black
                    families and coupled with the increasing white flight to northern suburbs, these trends had become a
                    local joke coined as “The City Too Busy Moving to Hate.”
