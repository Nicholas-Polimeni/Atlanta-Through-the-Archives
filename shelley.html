                <h3 class="subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">In 1945, the Shelley family was restricted from purchasing residential
                    property in a St. Louis neighborhood by Louis Kraemer, who had previously owned the home. Thirty of
                    the thirty-nine neighborhood’s residents had signed an agreement in 1911 stating the properties
                    would be restricted to white residents and buyers for the next fifty years. The Shelley family was
                    unaware of the agreement before their purchase and was denied both the home and suit, as the Court
                    found the Equal Protection Clause’s racial discirimination clause did not apply because the
                    neighborhood agreement was a private affair, not one of state.
