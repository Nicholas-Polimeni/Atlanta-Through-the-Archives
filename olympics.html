                <p class="paragraph-text">City officials use Hope VI Funding and plans for the upcoming Olympics to
                    systematically destroy the majority of Atlanta’s public housing.<br><br>
                    Throughout the 1990s, Atlanta housing was characterized by the combined effects of the upcoming 1996
                    olympic games and, in 1992, the enactment of the Hope VI program, which created a new initiative to
                    close existing public housing projects and build mixed-income housing on previous locations. In
                    Atlanta, officials set their sights on the country’s first two public housing projects, Techwood
                    Homes and Clark-Howell Homes, both desirable properties for the city’s redevelopment goals due to
                    their central location near the CBD and the future Olympic Games. Despite community resistance, the
                    current residents of these projects were given one option for aid with relocation -- Section 8
                    Vouchers, which federally subsidize rent in privately-owned urban housing. In 1996, these projects
                    were demolished, displacing 667 residents, the majority of whom were black; Recent research finds
                    that large numbers of residents were unable to even qualify for vouchers, and subsequently struggled
                    to obtain any form of government housing assistance (Diehl). In the years following the Olympics,
                    the redevelopment of the Techwood and Clark-Howell Homes neighborhoods resulted in raised property
                    values, which displaced even more families from their homes.
