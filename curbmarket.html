                <p class="paragraph-text">On land left decimated by the Great Fire of 1917 in Old Fourth Ward, a curb
                    market, with vendors housed in tents or outdoors, was created. It became very popular soon after
                    opening; in 1924, the market was profitable enough to build a large brick-and-mortar enclosure. As
                    Black vendors were not allowed to sell inside, many set up on the curb outside, inspiring the
                    nickname “Sweet Auburn Curb Market.” With the development of highways, which drained downtown of its
                    housing, and the rise of supermarkets, the market’s prominence waned but continued to be an
                    important resource for lower-income and Black communities nearby. Due to local support for the
                    market, it was eventually renovated by the city in advance of the 1996 Olympics and continues
                    operation to this day.
