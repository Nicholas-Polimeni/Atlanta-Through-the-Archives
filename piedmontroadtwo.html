                <p class="paragraph-text">A 32-unit complex, Westminster Apartments, was to be sold to the Atlanta
                    Housing Authority immediately after renovation by developers. After renovation, the complex was
                    expected to be low-rent housing. However, delays resulted in the developers failing to meet their
                    completion date.<br><br>
                    In response, the developers, Sandler Associates, Inc. and Environmental Planning Associates, filed a
                    3.7 million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Ansley Park Civic Association, representing
                    those on the AHAâ€™s waiting list; they claim that local residents intentionally caused delays to
                    prevent Black residents from moving into their neighborhood. Such delays included a lawsuit
                    attempting to revoke their building permit (Branch v. Housing Authority, 134 Ga. App. 906).
