                <p class="paragraph-text">An estimated 5,000 white men flood into Brownsville, attacking residents at
                    random in response to a violent incident and recent sensational and falsified news articles about
                    Black men who had committed sex crimes against White women.

                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    September 22, 1906.<br>
                    At 10:15 PM, a violent incident occurred on Decatur Street near Pryor, leaving a white man stabbed
                    at the hands of a black man. As the news spread quickly, a small group of about 50 gathered and
                    began pursuing a black man near the scene. It is unknown whether this was the same man who was
                    involved in the stabbing. <br><br>
                    The pursuit ended in front of the Piedmont Hotel, the crowd now at least hundreds in size, where the
                    man had sticks, bricks, and every other possible weapon thrown at him. The lone police officer on
                    the street attempted to come to his aid, with little success. One man reportedly held a newspaper
                    above the crowd that claimed black men were raping white women; these recent articles had drummed up
                    violent sentiment which broke out in mob violence, with the stabbing on September 22nd as the
                    trigger.<br><br>
                    At midnight, the mob headed to Peters Street. As they moved through the city, they destroyed
                    black-owned businesses and homes, including a hardware store, where they looted weapons and
                    ammunition.<br><br>
                    Shortly after, the crowd spotted Milton Brown, a black man who lived nearby. The crowd rushed him,
                    throwing stones. He managed to briefly escape from the crowd, only to be shot from the many
                    munitions which were just stolen. He was “literally torn to pieces” according to the Atlanta
                    Journal’s article from the incident.<br><br>
                    At 3 AM, a significant response was finally organized, with a state militia of 100 men that began
                    patrolling the streets. Heavy rain also began to pour, assisting the militia in clearing the
                    streets. Governor Terrell further called for eight companies of infantry and a battalion of light
                    artillery.<br><br>
                    25 black Atlantans were brutally killed and two white men were also left dead from the violence. Out
                    of concern for their safety, many black residents left the city or segregated themselves into safe,
                    black neighborhoods, like Auburn Avenue. To prevent future incidents, the Atlanta Way, an alliance
                    between business elites and the black political class of the city, was created.<br><br>
                    The Atlanta Race Riot was largely forgotten, or left undiscussed, in the history of Atlanta for over
                    a century. Mark Bauerlein’s 2001 book, Negrophobia: A Race Riot in Atlanta, and Rebecca Burn’s 2011
                    book, Rage in the Gate City: The Story of the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot, helped re-document this
                    history. In 2006, the city of Atlanta officially recognized the massacre, and in 2007, it finally
                    became part of the social studies curriculum for Georgia schools.<br><br>
