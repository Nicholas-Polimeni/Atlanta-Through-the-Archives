                <p class="paragraph-text">The 1960s was a decade filled with demographic shifts and policy campaigns
                    from Black Atlantans to gain rights, and white Atlantans to push for urban revitalization that
                    protects business interests while keeping Blacks out of white neighborhoods.<br><br>
                    On a national scale, important leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. Were fiercely campaigning for
                    Civil Rights legislation to desegregate schools, shops, and more. A local campaign to desegregate
                    the vendor permits for the Sweet Auburn Curb market proved to be successful. However, the litany of
                    changes occurring in Atlanta at the time made it so white flight was already set in motion, with
                    white Atlantans moving to neighborhoods in northern counties, and Black Atlantans were increasingly
                    displaced due to the zoning changes and highway construction. Collier Heights and West End were two
                    areas that witnessed the greatest levels of increased African American population.
