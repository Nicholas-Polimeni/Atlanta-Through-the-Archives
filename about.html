                <h3 class="subheading">Data Collection</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">Using the historic archives of the Atlanta Daily World, a historically Black
                    middle-class newspaper published in Atlanta, we aimed to collect data points representing racialized
                    public policy and planning events over the past century. The World was selected as it is the oldest
                    Black newspaper based in Atlanta, which provides the most extensive accounts of the civil rights
                    struggles of the Black middle class (Odum-Hinmon 2005). The ADW archives were systematically
                    searched to create a master list of articles using keywords surrounding public siting decisions and
                    racial markers. With the list of articles in place, events that were mentioned multiple times were
                    coded to create a more refined list of events – these would be the stories. Additionally, other data
                    sources, Atlanta Housing Authority’s list of public housing sites and Georgia State University’s
                    list of Urban Renewal Projects, were searched to provide more contextual information and provide
                    more direction to our search terms. Finally, using the various articles found, we were able to relay
                    the narratives constructed around each event and code them into relevant categories – public siting
                    decisions, zoning fights, or public housing demolition. Stories were then quantified and placed in
                    chronological order to tell the story of Atlanta through the years. By highlighting a few archetypal
                    stories in each category, the aim was to represent the larger story – redlining was not an
                    individual occurrence that created residential segregation or disparate access to resources; rather,
                    redlining was just one piece in a long history of racial motivations behind spatial decision making
                    in Atlanta that has impacted and continues to impact Atlanta and its people to this day.

                <p class="paragraph-text">Our core group learned so much in our academic year of working on this
                    project. We are excited for other folks to get involved and continue the vast research on the City
                    of Atlanta and its complicated history (and present). We hope that all who come next have a
                    similarly educational, exciting, and powerful experience.
                    We realize that in our short time, we did not have the capacity to research every important story,
                    but certain neighborhoods, time periods, issues, and data sources stuck out as areas we hope will be
                    pursued in the future.

                <h3 class="subheading">Data Geocoding</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">Geocoding each event mentioned in the articles was an iterative process based
                    on the information provided in each article. First, the article was searched for a street name or
                    address, then that information was put into Google Maps to see if it would come up. If the address
                    were valid, the geocode was recorded. If the street was valid, the article was again searched for a
                    cross street to identify a more specified location. If either street name did not show up, a
                    database of Atlanta historic street names and name changes, provided by Dr. Jamie Chung at Georgia
                    State University, was cross-checked, as well as a Wikipedia page – List of former Atlanta street
                    names. If no explicit address or street name was mentioned, we searched the article for any keywords
                    that might indicate geographic location: a neighborhood, area of the city, or establishment that
                    might provide a reference. If found, we researched the relevant reference to see where it might have
                    been. If more than one location was provided, both were researched and located. If the locations
                    were related, a polygon was drawn to include both locations. Additionally, if the article did not
                    specify a point location but referenced an area (such as a full block or a few blocks), that
                    location was recorded as a polygon rather than a point location.<br><br>

                    The analysis conducted is sensitive to spatial location. While this approach worked well for
                    locating the general areas mentioned in the data, the archival nature of the data does not give the
                    level of scale that might be necessary. For further research, a recommendation would be to access
                    more historical archives and maps, as well as look into oral history that might give clearer and
                    more precise location information for various events.
